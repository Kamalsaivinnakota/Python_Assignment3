## ðŸ§  Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function

### ðŸ”§ Problem Statement:
Write a Python program that:
1. Defines a function named `factorial()` that takes a number as an argument and calculates its factorial using a loop or recursion.
2. Returns the calculated factorial.
3. Calls the function with a sample number and prints the output.

### ðŸ’¡ Example Output:
If the function is called with `5`, the output should be: <br>
Factorial of `5` :120

## ðŸ§  Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations

### ðŸ”§ Problem Statement:
Write a Python program that:
1. Asks the user for a number as input.
2. Uses the `math` module to calculate:
   - âœ… Square root of the number
   - âœ… Natural logarithm (base e)
   - âœ… Sine of the number (in radians)
3. Displays the calculated results.

### ðŸ’¡ Example Output:
If the user enters `25`, the program should display:<br>
Square root of 25.0 is: 5.0 <br>
Natural log of 25.0 is: 3.2188758248682006 <br>
Sine of 25.0 radians is: -0.13235175009777303 <br>
```bash
python task1.py   # For factorial calculation
python task2.py   # For math module operations
